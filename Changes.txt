@page changes Changes

## Information for Packagers

- This is serial version 1.2.3. This is not a semver version number.

- This is shared object library version `libxlsxwriter.so.10`. This should be
  updated automatically via `make` and `cmake` as part of the build process.
  This version contains ABI changes since the previous release.

- Please report any downstream patches back upstream to help improve the overall
  build process.


## 1.2.3 Jun 30 2025

  `workbook_use_1904_epoch()`.

  Feature request [#483][gh_483].

  [gh_483]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/issues/483

- Fixed undefined behavior bugs in string indexing.

  Issue [#482][gh_482].

  [gh_482]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/issues/482


## 1.2.2 March 29 2025

  chart axis labels, the chart legend, the chart plot area and the chart title.
  See @ref chart_layout for more details.

  Feature request [#477][gh_477].

  [gh_477]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/issues/477


## 1.2.1 February 26 2025

- Added the `workbook_set_size()` function to set the size of the window when
  the file is opened. This is generally only useful on macOS since Microsoft
  Windows uses the window size from the last time an Excel file was
  opened/saved. Feature request [#472][gh_472].

  [gh_472]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/issues/472

- Improved the cmake build support for using the `minizip` library.
  Pull request [#471][gh_471].

  [gh_471]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/issues/471

- Fix buffer overflow in Table formula expansion.

### Packagers:

- This is serial version 1.2.1. This is not a semver version.

- This is shared object library version `libxlsxwriter.so.8`. This should be
  updated automatically via `make` and `cmake` as part of the build process.

- This version tries to improve the overall `cmake` build process when using
  minizip via the `-DUSE_SYSTEM_MINIZIP=ON` configuration option.

- Please report any downstream patches back upstream to help improve the overall
  build process.


## 1.2.0 January 11 2025

## 1.1.9 October 24 2024

 - Fix minor pointer/value error in `lxw_name_to_row()` and `lxw_name_to_col()`
   utility functions. Issue [#459][gh_459].

   [gh_459]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/issues/459


## 1.1.8 July 31 2024

- Added support for embedding images into worksheets with
  `worksheet_embed_image()`.

  This can be useful if you are building up a spreadsheet of products with a
  column of images for each product. Embedded images move with the cell so they
  can be used in worksheet tables or data ranges that will be sorted or
  filtered.

  This functionality is the equivalent of Excel's menu option to insert an image
  using the option to "Place in Cell" which is available in Excel 365 versions
  from 2023 onwards.

- Fixed various issues:

  - [Failure on 32bit architectures #441](https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/issues/441)
  - [workbook_validate_sheet_name buffer-overflow #442](https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/issues/442)
  - [workbook_add_worksheet does not return a reasonable worksheet #443](https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/issues/443)
  - [workbook_define_name stack-buffer-underflow #444](https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/issues/444)
  - [workbook_close stack-buffer-overflow #445](https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/issues/445)
  - [_store_array_formula heap-buffer-overflow #446](https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/issues/446)
  - [worksheet_set_selection stack-buffer-overflow #447](https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/issues/447)


- Note this version is tagged as `v1.1.8` instead of `RELEASE_1.1.8` for better
  interoperability with Xcode.


## 1.1.7 April 5 2024

- Bump `.so` version to 6. This was missed in the previous release.


## 1.1.6 April 4 2024

 `fmemopen()` and `open_memstream()` are supported. This requires the `USE_MEM_FILE`

  255 bytes instead of 255 characters and as a result UTF8
  strings were being truncated.

  Issue [#305][gh_305].

  [gh_305]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/issues/305


## 1.0.0 September 7 2020

  errors/warnings in user defined ranges.

  @ref chart_data_labels.c.

- Fix for issue where array formulas weren't included in the output file for
  certain ranges/conditions. Issue [#735][gh_735].

  [gh_735]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/XlsxWriter/issues/735


## 0.9.5 May 31 2020

- Fix for issue where hyperlinks urls and tips were ignored for
  `worksheet_insert_image_buffer_opt()` images.
  Issue [#292][gh_292].

  [gh_292]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/issues/292

- Added #LXW_CHART_LINE_STACKED and #LXW_CHART_LINE_STACKED_PERCENT line
  charts subtypes.

- Removed LXW_ERROR_SHEETNAME_RESERVED warning which was used with the
  reserved worksheet name "History". However, this is an allowed worksheet
  name in some Excel variants so the warning has been turned into a
  documentation note instead.


## 0.9.4 January 19 2020

- Added option to specify worksheet "object positioning" for images and charts
  to define how they move or size with underlying cells. See @ref
  ww_object_position_options and @ref working_with_object_positioning.


## 0.9.3 January 13 2020

- Fix Xcode/Cocoapods build warnings.


## 0.9.2 January 13 2020

- Added support for writing cell comments, see @ref working_with_comments.

  macOS.

- Changed function names in bundled MD5 code to avoid conflicts with OpenSSL.


## 0.9.1 December 26 2019

- Fix to missing MD5 linkage in Cocoapod file.
  Issue [#259][gh_259].

  [gh_259]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/issues/259


## 0.9.0 December 26 2019

- Fix to avoid duplicate images being copied to an libxlsxwriter file. Excel
  uses an optimization where it only stores one copy of a repeated/duplicate
  image in a workbook. Libxlsxwriter didn't do this which meant that the file
  size would increase when then was a large number of repeated images. This
  release fixes that issue and replicates Excel's behavior.

  Note, that this change adds a dependency on the [Openwall MD5] library,
  which is now included with the libxlsxwriter third party source files. It is
  possible to compile libxlsxwriter without this library, and thus getting the
  older behavior, by passing `USE_NO_MD5=1` to make.


  [Openwall MD5]: https://openwall.info/wiki/people/solar/software/public-domain-source-code/md5

## 0.8.9 December 16 2019

- Added support for default hyperlink style in `worksheet_write_url()`.

- Fixed several `worksheet_write_url()` edge cases.


## 0.8.8 November 17 2019

- Added option to allow a user defined, or overridden, image description used
  with `worksheet_insert_image()`. By default it uses the filename as the
  description.
  Issue [#238][gh_238].

  [gh_238]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/issues/238

- Added Windows portable version of `fopen` to handle utf8 filenames when
  working with images.
  Issue [#238][gh_238].

  [gh_238]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/issues/238

- Added an option to allow chart fonts to be rotation to 270 deg to give a
  stacked orientation. Also added support for East Asian vertical chart fonts.

- Refactored struct types used in pubic APIs to remove or document hidden
  fields. @b Note: This change introduces backward incompatible API
  changes. However, it should minimize any future changes of this nature.
  See issue [#252][gh_252].

  [gh_252]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/issues/252



## 0.8.7 June 20 2019

- Added support for adding VBA macros to workbooks. These macros can be
  extracted from existing xlsm files, created in Excel, and added to new xlsm
  files. See @ref working_with_macros.

  [gh_29]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/issues/29

- Added support for ZIP64 extensions when writing very large xlsx files to
  allow the zip container, or individual XML files within it, to be greater
  than 4 GB. See @ref workbook_new_opt().
  Feature request [#228][gh_228].

  [gh_228]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/issues/228

- Added extra validity checks on worksheet names.
  Issues [#223][gh_223] and [#230][gh_230].

  [gh_223]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/issues/223
  [gh_230]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/issues/230


## 0.8.6 April 7 2019

- Fixed issue where images that started in hidden rows/columns weren't placed
  correctly in the worksheet.

- Fixed the mime-type reported by system `file(1)`. The mime-type reported
  by "file --mime-type"/magic was incorrect for XlsxWriter files since it
  expected the `[Content_types]` to be the first file in the zip container.


## 0.8.5 February 10 2019

  Issue [#208][gh_208].
