@page getting_started Getting Started with libxlsxwriter

@tableofcontents

Here are some instructions to get you up and running with the libxlsxwriter
library on different OSes.


@section gsg_linux Installation on Linux

@subsection gsg_quick_start Quick-start on Linux

If you prefer to assemble Ikea furniture first and only read the instructions
when you have parts left over then the following minimal set of commands
should get you up and running on a Debian like system:

    sudo apt-get install -y zlib1g-dev
    git clone https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter.git
    cd libxlsxwriter
    make
    sudo make install

If you read instructions first and then assemble the furniture you will know
how to proceed.

@subsection gsg_dependencies Install the dependencies

The only dependency (apart from @ref running_the_tests "testing dependencies")
is [Zlib](http://www.zlib.net) version >= 1.2.8.

The easiest way to install `zlib` is from the source code:

    curl -O -L  http://www.zlib.net/zlib-1.2.11.tar.gz
    tar zxf zlib-1.2.11.tar.gz
    cd zlib-1.2.11

    ./configure
    make

    sudo make install

Alternatively, you can use your OS packager to install the `zlib` development
libraries. For example:

    sudo apt-get install -y zlib1g-dev

However, you need to ensure that the version installed is >= 1.2.8 or you will
get zlib related compilation issues.


@subsection gsg_git Get the source code via Git

Clone the libxlsxwriter source code repository from GitHub as follows:

    git clone https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter.git
    # Or use your preferred protocol instead of https.


@subsection gsg_tarball Get the source code as a tarball

If you prefer you can get a tarball of the latest code as follows:

    curl -O -L http://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter/archive/master.tar.gz


@subsection gsg_build Build the source code

Build the source code as follows:

    cd libxlsxwriter
    make

This will create a static and dynamic library in the local `./lib` directory:

    ls lib
    libxlsxwriter.a     libxlsxwriter.so

To see a verbose summary of the compilation steps use `V=1`:

    make V=1


@subsection gsg_examples Try an example

If there weren't any warnings or errors in the previous step (and there
shouldn't have been) then you can build the programs in the `examples`
directory and try one of them out:

    make examples
    ./examples/hello

This will create a `hello_world.xlsx` file in your current directory. Open the
file in a spreadsheet application. The output should look like this: @image
html hello01.png

There is a large range of tests that you can run but they have some additional
dependencies. If you are interested see @ref running_the_tests.


@subsection gsg_install Install the library

Libxlsxwriter supports a simplified installation scheme for a static and
dynamic/shared library and header files.

    sudo make install

The files are installed to `/usr/local` by default but this can be overridden
by using the `PREFIX` environmental variable:

    make install PREFIX=/usr/third_party

A staging directory can be set with `DESTDIR` which is prepended to all
install paths, a feature mostly useful for packaging:

    make install PREFIX=/usr/third_party DESTDIR=./staging/

This would build and link the code with `/usr/third_party` as the
installation location but actually install to `./staging/usr/third_party`.

This installation method isn't fool proof but if it fails on your system you
will probably know exactly how to fix it or have no idea how to fix it. I'm
hoping for the former.


@subsection gsg_using Using the library

Using you favourite editor create a file like the following called
`myexcel.c`:

@code
    #include "xlsxwriter.h"

    int main() {

        lxw_workbook  *workbook  = workbook_new("myexcel.xlsx");
        lxw_worksheet *worksheet = workbook_add_worksheet(workbook, NULL);
        int row = 0;
        int col = 0;

        worksheet_write_string(worksheet, row, col, "Hello me!", NULL);

        return workbook_close(workbook);
    }
    @endcode

If you executed the `"make install"` command in the previous section then you
should be able to compile the program as follows:

    cc myexcel.c -o myexcel -lxlsxwriter

In some environments, or if you changed the `PREFIX` location, you may
have to provide explicit `include` and `lib` paths:

    cc myexcel.c -o myexcel -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lxlsxwriter

This will create an executable that you can run to generate an Excel
spreadsheet:

    ./myexcel
    xdg-open myexcel.xlsx

If the installation didn't work for you then you can link against the static
library you created in the "Build the source code" step:

    cc myexcel.c -o myexcel -I /path/to/libxlsxwriter/include \
                               /path/to/libxlsxwriter/lib/libxlsxwriter.a -lz


@section gsg_bsd Installation on FreeBSD and OpenBSD

Installation on FreeBSD and OpenBSD is mainly the same as on Linux, see above,
with the differences outlined below.

Both FreeBSD and OpenBSD come with the zlib development libraries
pre-installed so there are no additional dependencies. However, if you have
any issues then follow the instructions
@ref gsg_dependencies "to install zlib".


@ref gsg_git or @ref gsg_tarball "get the source code as a tarball" as shown
above then build the source code as follows using `gmake` (not make):

    cd libxlsxwriter
    gmake

Then follow the instructions in the Linux section to
@ref gsg_install "install the library" and
@ref gsg_using "use the library".


@section gsg_macos Installation on macOS and iOS

The instructions for installing on Linux, shown above, will also work on
macOS.

To install for Xcode and iOS use the Cocoa Pods method shown in the next
section.

On macOS you can also use [brew/homebrew](https://brew.sh), see below.

@subsection gsg_cocoapods Install using Cocoa Pods for Xcode

For iOS and macOS projects in Xcode you can install libxlsxwriter using
[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org).

For a sample Xcode project that uses the libxlsxwriter cocoapod for iOS and
macOS with Objective-C and Swift see [libxlsxwriter Cocoa
Examples](https://github.com/lrossi/libxlsxwriterCocoaExamples), provided by
Ludovico Rossi.

@subsection gsg_brew Installation on macOS with homebrew

On macOS you can also use [brew/homebrew](https://brew.sh):

    brew install libxlsxwriter

Once installed you can compile and run a libxlsxwriter program as follows:

    cc myexcel.c -o myexcel -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lxlsxwriter
    ./myexcel

@section gsg_cmake Install using CMake

Libxlsxwriter also supports [CMake](https://cmake.org) for building and
installing the library, as follows:

    cmake $SOURCE_DIR $FLAGS

For example:

    cd cmake
    cmake ..
    make
    make install

@subsection gsg_cmake_flags CMake Flags

Certain build features can be controlled by passing flags to Cmake. For
example:

    cd cmake
    cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
    make

    # Run the unit tests.
    ./xlsxwriter_unit

Some of the Libxlsxwriter specific flags are:

- `BUILD_STATIC`: Build static libraries (default on). To build shared
   libraries, pass `-DBUILD_STATIC=OFF` during configuration.

- `BUILD_EXAMPLES`: Build example files (default off). To build the examples,
   pass `-DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON` during configuration.

- `BUILD_TESTS`: Build unittests (default off). To build the unittests, pass
  `-DBUILD_TESTS=ON` during configuration.

- `ZLIB_ROOT`: The ZLIB root directory can be specified either through an
   environment variable (`export ZLIB_ROOT=/usr/include`) or using a flag with
   CMake (`-DZLIB_ROOT:STRING=/usr/include`). This sets the preferred search
   path for the ZLIB installation.

@subsection gsg_cmake_options CMake Options

CMake sets debug and release builds with the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` option. To
build in release mode, pass `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` during configuration.

@subsection gsg_cmake_generators CMake Generators

CMake also supports custom build generators, such as Makefiles, Ninja, Visual
Studio, and Xcode. For example, to generate a Visual Studio solution,
configure with:

    cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"

For more information on using generators see:
[cmake-generators](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html).

@subsection gsg_cmake_app Cmake for Microsoft Visual Studio

You can also use Cmake to build a Microsoft Visual Studio (although see also
the next section on using vcpkg which is less manual).

Open a Windows CMD or Command Window and set up your MSVC environment, if
required.

Then create a work directory and and an install directory that the include and
library files will be installed to. Set the follow variables to point to the
directories:

    set    WORK_DIR=C:/Users/Username/tmp
    set INSTALL_DIR=C:/Users/Username/tmp/install_dir


Build the Zlib library:

    cd %WORK_DIR%

    git clone https://github.com/madler/zlib.git
    cd zlib
    mkdir build
    cd    build

    cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 Win64" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH="%INSTALL_DIR%/zlib"

    cmake --build . --config Release --target install

Build the libxlsxwriter library:

    cd %WORK_DIR%

    git clone https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter.git
    cd libxlsxwriter
    mkdir build
    cd    build

    cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 Win64" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH="%INSTALL_DIR%/libxlsxwriter" -DZLIB_ROOT:STRING="%INSTALL_DIR%/zlib"

    cmake --build . --config Release --target install


Create a new Win32 Console (or other C/C++) application in Visual Studio:

    File
      -> New
        -> Project

    Visual C++
      -> Win32
        -> Win32 Console Application


Change the ARCH in the main Dialog to "x64" and the Configuration to "Release"
(or to match the parameter to cmake).

Replace the empty main with a libxlsxwriter example from the distro. Make sure
to include "stdafx.h" and "xlsxwriter.h":

@code
#include "stdafx.h"
#include "xlsxwriter.h"

int main() {

    lxw_workbook  *workbook = workbook_new("hello_world.xlsx");
    lxw_worksheet *worksheet = workbook_add_worksheet(workbook, NULL);

    worksheet_write_string(worksheet, 0, 0, "Hello", NULL);
    worksheet_write_number(worksheet, 1, 0, 123, NULL);

    workbook_close(workbook);

    return 0;
}
@endcode

Edit the application properties:

    Project
      -> ConsoleApplication Properties

Set the libxlsxwriter include path to match the path used above:

    Configuration Properties
      -> C/C++
        -> General
          -> Additional Include Directories

    Set it to the following (or similar path used above):

    C:\Users\Username\tmp\install_dir\libxlsxwriter\include

Set the linker directories to match the path created above:

    Configuration Properties
      -> Linker
        -> General
          -> Additional Library Directories

    Add the following (or similar paths used above):

    C:\Users\Username\tmp\install_dir\libxlsxwriter\lib\x64\Release
    C:\Users\Username\tmp\install_dir\zlib\lib

Set the linker additional libraries to match the zlib and xlsxwriter libs
created above:

    Configuration Properties
      -> Linker
         -> Input
            -> Additional Dependencies

    Add the following:

    xlsxwriter.lib
    zlib.lib

Build the solution and run the output executable. It should create a
hello_world.xlsx file in the same directory you ran it from.


@section gsg_vcpkg Using libxlsxwriter in Microsoft Visual Studio via vcpkg

A convenient way to get the latest release version of libxlsxwriter and
integrate it into your Visual Studio build environment is to use the
[vcpkg](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vcpkg?view=vs-2019 )
tool. This uses the CMake build system shown in the previous section but with
less user interaction. From the vcpkg docs:

> "vcpkg" is a command-line package manager that greatly simplifies the
> acquisition and installation of third-party libraries on Windows, Linux and
> MacOS. If your project uses third-party libraries, we recommend that you use
> vcpkg to install them. vcpkg supports both open-source and proprietary
> libraries. All libraries in the vcpkg Windows catalog have been tested for
> compatibility with Visual Studio 2015, Visual Studio 2017, and Visual
> Studio 2019.

Install vcpkg and libxlsxwriter as follows in Windows CMD or Powershell:

    > git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
    > bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
    > vcpkg install libxlsxwriter

You should then see libxlsxwriter installed as follows (note that the required
zlib dependency has also been installed):

    > vcpkg list
    libxlsxwriter:x86-windows  0.8.6-1   Libxlsxwriter is a C library that ...
    zlib:x86-windows           1.2.11-5  A compression library

You can also install libxlsxwriter for other build targets like `x64`

    > vcpkg install libxlsxwriter:x64-windows

    > vcpkg list
    libxlsxwriter:x64-windows  0.8.6-1   Libxlsxwriter is a C library that ...
    libxlsxwriter:x86-windows  0.8.6-1   Libxlsxwriter is a C library that ...
    zlib:x64-windows           1.2.11-5  A compression library
    zlib:x86-windows           1.2.11-5  A compression library

To use libxlsxwriter from within Visual Studio you can "integrate" it into
your environment:

    > vcpkg integrate install
    Applied user-wide integration for this vcpkg root.

All MSBuild C projects can now include libxlsxwriter directly. Linking will
also be handled automatically. For example, create a new Win32 Console (or
other C/C++) application in Visual Studio:

    File
      -> New
        -> Project

    Visual C++
      -> Win32
        -> Win32 Console Application

Replace the empty main with a libxlsxwriter example from the distro. Make sure
to include "stdafx.h" and "xlsxwriter.h":

@code
#include "stdafx.h"
#include "xlsxwriter.h"

int main() {

    lxw_workbook  *workbook = workbook_new("hello_world.xlsx");
    lxw_worksheet *worksheet = workbook_add_worksheet(workbook, NULL);

    worksheet_write_string(worksheet, 0, 0, "Hello", NULL);
    worksheet_write_number(worksheet, 1, 0, 123, NULL);

    workbook_close(workbook);

    return 0;
}
@endcode

Change the target to "Release" and the architecture to "x86" (or whatever you
installed above). You can now "Build Solution". The resulting executable will
be put in the output directory with the required "xlsxwriter.dll" and
"zlib1.dll" files.


@section gsg_tmpdir Specifying a TEMP directory for libxlsxwriter

The libxlsxwriter library creates temporary files in the system `TEMP`
directory during assembly of an xlsx file. On Windows this directory may not
be writeable by a libxlsxwriter application (although it will try several
`TEMP` locations before returning an error). To work around this you can set
the `tmpdir` parameter of the #lxw_workbook_options struct and pass it to
`workbook_new_opt()`:

@code
   lxw_workbook_options options = {.constant_memory = LXW_FALSE,
                                   .tmpdir = "C:\\Temp"};

   lxw_workbook  *workbook  = workbook_new_opt("filename.xlsx", &options);
@endcode

This can also be used on Unix systems where the `TEMP` directory isn't
writeable.

The TEMP file handling with optional temporary directory support is provided
by the
[Tmpfileplus](http://www.di-mgt.com.au/c_function_to_create_temp_file.html)
library which is included in the source tree. If you wish to use the standard
library `tmpfile()` function instead you can compile without `tmpfileplus` as
follows:

    make USE_STANDARD_TMPFILE=1

@note When using the the standard library `tmpfile()` the `tmpdir` parameter,
shown above, is ignored.

@section gsg_ming Installation on Windows using Mingw-w64 and MSYS2

The libxlsxwriter library can also be compiled on Windows using the
[Mingw-w64](http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php) "Minimalist GNU for Windows"
toolchain. These tools can be run from the Windows `cmd.exe` but it is
recommended to use the [MSYS2](http://msys2.github.io) "Minimal System" Bourne
Shell.

Here are some instructions on how to compile libxlsxwriter with Mingw-w64 and
MSYS2:

    # Install MSYS2 64 or 32 bit from http://msys2.github.io/

    # Install the dev tools for libxlsxwriter.
    pacman -S git gcc make zlib-devel

    # Clone and build libxlsxwriter.
    git clone https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter.git
    cd libxlsxwriter/
    make

After compilation you can follow the instructions in the @ref gsg_install and
@ref gsg_using sections above. When using the library you may also need to
link against the zlib library using `-lz`:

    gcc myexcel.c -o myexcel -lxlsxwriter -lz

It is also possible to use [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com) and the older [MinGW
and MSYS](http://mingw.org). Libxlsxwriter has been confirmed to compile and
work in all of these environments.

See also @ref gsg_tmpdir.

@section gsg_minizip Linking against system minizip

Libxlsxwriter uses the `minizip` component of [Zlib](http://www.zlib.net) to
create the xlsx zip file container. The source files for `minizip` are
included in the src tree of libxlsxwriter and are statically linked by
default.

If you have a `lminizip` library already installed on your system and prefer
to dynamically link against that you can use the following compilation option:

    make USE_SYSTEM_MINIZIP=1

@section gsg_endian Compiling on Big Endian Architecture

Libxlsxwriter can be compiled on a big endian system as follows:

    make USE_BIG_ENDIAN=1

@section gsg_next Next steps

If you got libxlsxwriter built and working successfully then the next sections
will look at how to create some more in-depth examples.
